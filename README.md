# GLOBE-CE

Codebase for the paper [GLOBE-CE: A Translation-Based Approach for Global Counterfactual Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17021), published at ICML 2023.

Given the number of recent requests for this code, we have pushed the datasets, models and classes used in our experiments.

An implementation of the [AReS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07165) method is also provided, including our custom enhancements (detailed in Appendix C of our work).

Please raise a pull request or reach out to Dan Ley directly if there are any issues.
