Given the recent requests, we have pushed the datasets, models and classes used in our experiments.

An implementation of the [AReS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07165) method is also provided (including our custom enhancements detailed in Appendix C).

Please raise a pull request or reach out to Dan Ley directly if there are any issues (email address provided in the paper).
