# GLOBE-CE: Global & Efficient Counterfactual Explanations

From the ICML 2023 paper [GLOBE-CE: A Translation-Based Approach for Global Counterfactual Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17021) by Dan Ley, Saumitra Mishra, and Daniele Magazzeni.

Given recent requests, we have pushed the datasets, models and classes used in our experiments. The `globe_ce.py` file contains the main implementation of our method.

An implementation of the [AReS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07165) method is also provided, including our enhancements as detailed in Appendix C.

Any questions regarding the method or implementation can be directed to Dan Ley (email address provided in the paper). Feel free also to create an issue or pull request.
